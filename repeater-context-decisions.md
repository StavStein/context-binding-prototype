# Repeater & Context — Product Decisions

> Final decisions after stakeholder alignment. Option A selected: **Context lives on the repeater.**

---

## 1. Where Will the Context Live

**Decision: Repeater is a context provider — contexts can be attached directly to it.**

Rationale:
- Reduces reparenting issues on drag & drop — context moves with the repeater
- Allows 2 repeaters with the same context type but different configurations on the same section (each owns its own instance)
- Follows the same UX pattern as sections — same add/remove/represent experience

When a `list` context is attached to a repeater and the Items property is unbound, the Items property is **automatically bound** to the context's array field — no extra step needed.

The user can **also** bind Items to a context that lives on a parent (section/page) — the repeater doesn't have to own a context.

> **TBD:** UX to make it clear that a coupled context is not mandatory — avoid confusion between "repeater owns context" vs. "repeater consumes parent context."

---

## 2. Context Picker (Items Property)

When binding the Items property, the context picker should:
- Show the repeater's own context as an option (if it has one)
- Use it as the **default selection**
- Display a scope badge: **"This repeater"**
- Also show parent contexts (section/page) as alternatives

---

## 3. Shadowing (Same Context on Parent and Child)

**Decision: Allowed.** The same context type can exist at both parent and child levels. The **closest instance wins** (proximity resolution).

- When adding a context that already exists on a parent → informational message, not blocked
- Elements bind to the nearest instance automatically
- Promote flow remains available as an alternative

---

## 4. Copy & Paste

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Repeater with coupled context | Context is **duplicated** (new instance) |
| Repeater consuming parent context | Context is **not** duplicated — binding references the parent |

---

## 5. Drag & Drop (Reparenting)

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Context coupled with repeater | Context moves with the repeater. No impact on other elements. Bindings stay intact. |
| Context inherited from parent | **TBD.** Suggestion: context stays in the original section. User must choose: **copy context to new section** / **promote to page** / **disconnect**. |

---

## 6. Sort, Filter & Page Size

- Configured on the **context instance** (not on the repeater directly)
- Accessed via repeater settings → **"Edit context instance"** (floating panel)
- If the repeater uses a parent context → also accessible via section settings → context configuration
- Applies only to the **main records array** (e.g., `items`). Other arrays (e.g., nested `tags`) are not affected by context-level sort/filter

### Page Size vs. Display Limit

These are two independent controls:

| | **Page Size** | **Display Limit** |
|---|---|---|
| **Belongs to** | Context instance | Repeater |
| **What it controls** | How many items are fetched per pagination batch | How many items are shown in total |
| **Configured in** | Context settings panel | Repeater settings → "Show limited number of items" |
| **Example** | 36 items per scroll batch | Show only top 3 |
| **Affects UoU pagination** | Yes — determines batch size for infinite scroll / load more | No — hard cap regardless of pagination |

**Example:** A context has 1,000 records with page size = 36 and infinite scroll enabled. The repeater has "Show limited number" = 3. The user sees exactly 3 items — no further scrolling loads more. The page size remains 36 on the context (relevant if another repeater consumes the same context without a display limit).

The repeater settings panel shows a **read-only preview** of the context's page size, filter, and sort. To change them, the user clicks "Edit context settings" which opens the context configuration panel.

---

## 7. Array Binding

**Decision: Users can bind any array, including non-records / item-level arrays.**

- Inner elements can bind to **two levels of fields**:
  - **Item-level fields** (from the bound array) — unique per repeater item
  - **Context-level fields** (from the parent context) — same value across all items. The binding UI should clearly indicate this distinction (e.g., "Same value across all rows")
- Sub-arrays do **not** have context-level sort/filter/page size — if the user needs that, they bind to a **function** that returns a filtered/sorted array

### 7a. Nested Repeaters

A repeater inside a repeater item — e.g., a tags repeater inside each article item. The inner repeater binds to a sub-array field (e.g., `items › tags`).

**Field dropdown behavior:**
- The Items dropdown recursively collects all array and multiReference fields, including nested ones
- Nested fields show a hierarchy path: `items › tags`
- When a nested array is selected, inner elements expose the sub-array's own fields (e.g., `tag value`), not the parent context's top-level fields

**Per-item scope:**
- Each inner repeater instance can have a **different item count** based on the data of its parent item (e.g., article 1 has 3 tags, article 2 has 2 tags, article 3 has 4 tags)
- Context-level fields (e.g., `totalItems`) show the **same value** across all inner items

**Disconnect / reconnect lifecycle:**
- Disconnecting the inner repeater's Items is a cascading action — removes all inner element bindings
- After disconnect: all inner repeaters normalize to **3 default placeholder items** (the standard empty state)
- A yellow warning appears **only on the first (template) inner repeater**: "Repeater is not connected to data. Connect Items to an array."
- The full state (DOM, bindings, per-item counts) is saved on disconnect and **restored on reconnect** — the user gets back exactly what they had before
- **Outer repeater disconnect cascades to inner repeaters:** When the outer repeater's Items is disconnected, all inner repeaters also disconnect — including their own Items binding — since the inner array field (e.g., `tags`) comes from the same context. All items become identical placeholders. Inner repeater pills are cleared, elements reset to default, and styles are preserved. Reconnecting the outer repeater restores the full nested state

**Field path display:**
- Inside a repeater, bound fields show their **full array path** in the property panel and canvas bind tags
- Item-level fields are prefixed with the array name: `items.title`, `items.thumbnail`, `tags.tag value`
- Context-level fields (e.g., `totalItems`) are shown **without a prefix** — they are not scoped to the array
- The inner repeater's Items binding also shows the path relative to its parent: `items.tags` (since `tags` is a sub-array of `items`)
- This convention applies to all display locations: property panel chips, canvas bind tags, repeater pills, image controller, and alt text

**Visual behavior:**
- Nested repeaters have a **transparent border by default** — they don't clutter the canvas
- Border appears on **hover** (subtle gray), **direct selection** (accent), or **child selection** (faded accent)
- This avoids the "pink rectangles everywhere" problem in deeply nested layouts

## 8. Add Repeater from CMS Presets

**Option 1 — Preset without data (blank):**
- Repeater is added unbound
- **TBD:** Live site behavior — recommendation: collapse unconfigured repeater

**Option 2 — Preset with unconfigured state:**
- Repeater is collapsed in live site until configured
- User chooses:
  - **Use existing collection** → if context does not exist on any parent, add to repeater
  - **Create new collection** → create from preset schema, attach context to repeater
  - **Use as blank** → keep unbound, no context

---

## 9. Add Blank Repeater

- User drags a repeater (e.g., from quick add) that is **not connected**
- User can design and drag elements into it freely
- If user tries to bind inner elements before the repeater's Items has data → **suggest auto-binding the repeater** to the selected array alongside the element
- When binding the Items property, the context picker shows:
  - **Parent contexts** → "Use from page/section." Repeater references parent's context
  - **"+ Add context"** → Context created on the repeater. Exists only for it

**TBD:**
- Default items when unbound — how many items to show in editor? What content? (coordinate with Viewer team)
- Live site behavior before bound — collapse? Show placeholder? Hide entirely?

---

## 10. Add Pre-Bound Repeater (e.g., Products Gallery)

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Relevant context exists on parent | **Inherit from parent.** No context added to the repeater. |
| No relevant context on parent | **Context added on the repeater.** Repeater owns it. |

---

## 11. UoU Interactions (Sort, Filter, Pagination, Total Items)

- Context **must be promoted to section first** — then external controls can bind to it
- Same requirement for any context-level data outside repeater items (e.g., `itemsCount`)
- Promote suggestion appears:
  - In **repeater settings** — message suggesting to promote when context is coupled
  - In **binding dropdown** for external elements — shows the repeater's context with a "Promote to section" action

**Promote is a move, not a copy.** After promoting, the context is removed from the repeater's scope and exists **only** on the section. The repeater then inherits the context from its parent section, like any other element in that section.

### ⚠️ Filter ceiling principle (requires R&D approval)

Context-level filters set by the site builder define the **maximum dataset boundary**. When UoU filters are applied at runtime by the site visitor (e.g., search bar, filter dropdown), they operate **within** the context filter — they can only **narrow** the results, never **widen** them.

**Example:** If the builder filtered the context to show only "Tech" articles, a visitor using a UoU search bar can search within Tech articles only — they cannot discover or access articles from other categories.

**Implication for R&D:** The runtime query pipeline must enforce context-level filters as a hard constraint that UoU filters cannot override. The UoU filter is applied **on top of** (intersected with) the context filter — not as a replacement.

> **TBD:** Exact UX for the promote suggestion in the binding dropdown.

### ⚠️ Disconnect confirmation modal

Disconnecting a repeater's "Items" binding is a **high-impact action** — it cascades to all inner element bindings. Unlike most properties (where disconnect is silent), the repeater **should trigger a confirmation modal** before proceeding.

**Open question (R&D + Product):** Is this a **component-level opt-in** (the repeater declares that its disconnect needs confirmation) or should the platform **automatically detect** high-impact disconnects? See [Binding Controller spec — Open TBD #5](binding-platform-demo.html#spec=binding-controller).

---

## 12. System Contexts

System contexts (User, Site, Router) appear **only at page level** — not on sections or repeaters. Always available, cannot be removed.

---

## 13. Field Path Display in Repeaters

**Decision: Item-level fields display their full array path.**

When an element inside a repeater is bound to a field from the repeater's array, the display name includes the array prefix:
- `items.title`, `items.thumbnail`, `items.author` — for fields inside the main records array
- `tags.tag value` — for fields inside a sub-array (nested repeater)
- `totalItems` — context-level fields show **no prefix** (they are not scoped to an array)

The inner repeater's Items chip shows the path relative to the parent: `items.tags` (since `tags` is a sub-array of `items`).

**Applies to:** property panel chips, canvas bind tags, repeater pills, image Source & Alt text, and repeater item count labels.

**Rationale:** This makes it clear which fields come from the repeater's array iteration (per-item) vs. which come from the context itself (shared). The plural form (`items.`) was chosen because it matches the field hierarchy in the context definition.
